# Broadcast-Nukkit
A simple plugin that allows you to broadcast a message via command. (For Nukkit)

##How do I download?
###Easy! I've already compiled my plugin into a JAR. You can download it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/applqpak/Broadcast-Nukkit/master/Broadcast.jar), once downloaded, drop it in your plugin's folder and (re)start your Nukkit server!

##Usage?
###To broadcast a message via command, simply run /broadcast < message >. Keep in mind you may use /bc in place of /broadcast.
